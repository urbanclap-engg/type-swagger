Swagger is like the DNA of our microservice communication.

The aim of this repository is to automate interactions with swagger and ease interservice developement.

Three major steps to do this 

1.  convert swagger to interfaces for any language (current support of ts only)
1.  create swagger schemas from type files
1.  provide a way to automate all this
